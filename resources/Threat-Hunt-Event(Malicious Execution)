# Threat Event (Malicious File Execution)

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took to Create Logs and IoCs:

1. Downloaded a malicious file to the machine. `wget https://github.com/Goodka7/Threat-Hunting-Malicious-Execution-/blob/main/resources/MaliciousFile.sh`
2. Make the file executable. `chmod +x malicious_script.sh`
2. Execute the malicious file, simulating a compromise. `./malicious_script.sh`
